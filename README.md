## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### Useful resources

- [A Formik POC live at Vercel](https://formik-poc-six.vercel.app/) - The form in this application is considerably big and it has to be able to add / remove groups of fields without losing the ability to validate them. I decided to use Formik and created this POC in order to learn how to use it properly. After adding a few features I had the knowledge needed to tackle bigger forms.
