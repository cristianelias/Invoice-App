## Overview

  

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
  
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Create, read, update, and delete invoices

- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice

- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid

- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)

- Toggle light and dark mode

-  **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### Useful resources

  

-  [A Formik POC live at Vercel](https://formik-poc-six.vercel.app/) - The form in this application is kind of complex, it must allow the user to add / remove groups of fields without losing the ability to validate them. I decided to use Formik and created this POC in order to learn how to use it properly. After adding a few features I had the knowledge needed to tackle bigger forms.
